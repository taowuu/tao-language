### 拖延症的一天
I gotta eat<br />You gotta tell him<br />They've gotta do it<br />He's gotta go to the gym

Just a sec<br />Wait a sec

It's time for bed<br />It's time to go to school

You really need to pull yourself together 

I realize I need to pull myself together

Your need to save you from yourself

I'm gonna wake up late

I decided to get up early

I'm gonna grab some lunch
### 开车看望朋友
2-hour drive

buckle up

You're supposed to finish the presentation

turn right onto Changan street

I switched my study focus from math to English

The concert was fully packed
### 回忆起那时
I'd like to pose a question<br />The photographer told me to hold the pose <br />All his so-called friends deserted him when he went broken<br />He threw one million dollars at the so-called masterpiece<br />get to know Chinese culture<br />I really need to get to know the city better<br />I'd really want to see you again and get to know you better<br />I'll leave you to get to know each other <br />The ball hit him right in the face<br />I'll be right back<br />I have an interest in basketball<br />I'm interested in basketball<br />This tradition can traced back to the Qing Dynasty<br />We can't trace the origin of this vase back to any specific period<br />She gave us a demonstration of the machine to show us how it worked<br />It was a very good demonstration of his capability to do this work
